# Grabby

This is yet another simple script that is currently written only in JS but will be also written in PHP so it can be used almost anywhere without any problems. Bascially when someone connects to you website where you script is being used 2 requests will happen 1. request will be request that will get detailed information about client and it will be stored in separated variables 2. request is request that we are sending to Discord to acutally send that informations about client to Discord chat (it can be gorup/server/normal DM with someone).

## Instalation

JS:

```
Put grabby.js in your website files and include it at bottom of your HTML file or you can put it in onload in body of your HTML so it will be executed automatically when HTML loads
```

PHP: 

```
Put grabby.php in your website files and you can even rename it to be index.php if you prefer it more and bascially you are done and you can enjoy.
```

## Note 

This script isnt made for some malicious activites it is made only for fun and educational purposes because im interested in learning more about php and js at the moment so ill probably post even more of those here on my GitHub
